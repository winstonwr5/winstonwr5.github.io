# Minute Quiz
======

Hi everyone! This is Minute Quiz, my first project - built around a subject I'm ~obsessed with~ quite fond of: Random Trivia!

This project was built to filter the Open Trivia Database API through a framework of `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, and `jQuery`. Using `AJAX`, I accessed the API information and selected specific information (namely, the question category, type (true/false or multiple choice))

## Rules
======

*An abridged version of these rules appears in an onscreen modal when the "Rules" button is pressed in the quiz!*

The rules of the quiz are simple: try to answer as many of the questions as possible within the 60 seconds given (and displayed!) for a round.

Players enter their text answers in the input field under the question and submit by pressing `enter`. Correct answers produce a JS alert simply stating

> Correct!

Incorrect answers produce a JS alert in the format below, with the correct answer inserted.

> Incorrect! The Correct Answer is ___________

After 60 seconds, the quiz ends and a very pleasant Game Over message modal pops on-screen.

## Unsolved Problems
======

This project was very challenging but extraordinarily fulfilling, mostly because I finally started to get a good sense of Scope - a concept which has confused me since the start.

The only real unsolved problems I had with this setup were:

1. creating functioning arrays into which I could push the final tally of correct and incorrect answers

2. Working out a kink in the `close` button on my Game End modal. The game still functions perfectly if the page is reloaded but I had to move on from that problem and I'd love to know why it doesn't work.
